## When NOT to Use Expressions

### ❌ Code Nodes

Code nodes use **direct JavaScript access**, NOT expressions!

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG in Code node
const email = '={{$json.email}}';
const name = '{{$json.body.name}}';

// ✅ CORRECT in Code node
const email = $json.email;
const name = $json.body.name;

// Or using Code node API
const email = $input.item.json.email;
const allItems = $input.all();
```

### ❌ Webhook Paths

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
path: "{{$json.user_id}}/webhook"

// ✅ CORRECT
path: "user-webhook"  // Static paths only
```

### ❌ Credential Fields

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
apiKey: "={{$env.API_KEY}}"

// ✅ CORRECT
Use n8n credential system, not expressions
```

## Working Examples

For real workflow examples, see EXAMPLES.md

### Example 1: Webhook to Slack

**Webhook receives**:
```json
{
  "body": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "message": "Hello!"
  }
}
```

**In Slack node text field**:
```
New form submission!

Name: {{$json.body.name}}
Email: {{$json.body.email}}
Message: {{$json.body.message}}
```

### Example 2: HTTP Request to Email

**HTTP Request returns**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {"name": "Product 1", "price": 29.99}
    ]
  }
}
```

**In Email node** (reference HTTP Request):
```
Product: {{$node["HTTP Request"].json.data.items[0].name}}
Price: ${{$node["HTTP Request"].json.data.items[0].price}}
```

### Example 3: Format Timestamp

```javascript
// Current date
{{$now.toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd')}}
// Result: 2025-10-20

// Time
{{$now.toFormat('HH:mm:ss')}}
// Result: 14:30:45

// Full datetime
{{$now.toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm')}}
// Result: 2025-10-20 14:30
```

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
