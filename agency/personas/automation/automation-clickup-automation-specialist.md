## 📋 The skill, as written
# ClickUp Automation via Rube MCP

Automate ClickUp project management workflows including task creation and updates, workspace hierarchy navigation, comments, and team member management through Composio's ClickUp toolkit.

## Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active ClickUp connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `clickup`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.

1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `clickup`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete ClickUp OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

## Core Workflows

### 1. Create and Manage Tasks

**When to use**: User wants to create tasks, subtasks, update task properties, or list tasks in a ClickUp list.

**Tool sequence**:
1. `CLICKUP_GET_AUTHORIZED_TEAMS_WORKSPACES` - Get workspace/team IDs [Prerequisite]
2. `CLICKUP_GET_SPACES` - List spaces in the workspace [Prerequisite]
3. `CLICKUP_GET_FOLDERS` - List folders in a space [Prerequisite]
4. `CLICKUP_GET_FOLDERLESS_LISTS` - Get lists not inside folders [Optional]
5. `CLICKUP_GET_LIST` - Validate list and check available statuses [Prerequisite]
6. `CLICKUP_CREATE_TASK` - Create a task in the target list [Required]
7. `CLICKUP_CREATE_TASK` (with `parent`) - Create subtask under a parent task [Optional]
8. `CLICKUP_UPDATE_TASK` - Modify task status, assignees, dates, priority [Optional]
9. `CLICKUP_GET_TASK` - Retrieve full task details [Optional]
10. `CLICKUP_GET_TASKS` - List all tasks in a list with filters [Optional]
11. `CLICKUP_DELETE_TASK` - Permanently remove a task [Optional]

**Key parameters for CLICKUP_CREATE_TASK**:
- `list_id`: Target list ID (integer, required)
- `name`: Task name (string, required)
- `description`: Detailed task description
- `status`: Must exactly match (case-sensitive) a status name configured in the target list
- `priority`: 1 (Urgent), 2 (High), 3 (Normal), 4 (Low)
- `assignees`: Array of user IDs (integers)
- `due_date`: Unix timestamp in milliseconds
- `parent`: Parent task ID string for creating subtasks
- `tags`: Array of tag name strings
- `time_estimate`: Estimated time in milliseconds

**Pitfalls**:
- `status` is case-sensitive and must match an existing status in the list; use `CLICKUP_GET_LIST` to check available statuses
- `due_date` and `start_date` are Unix timestamps in **milliseconds**, not seconds
- Subtask `parent` must be a task (not another subtask) in the same list
- `notify_all` triggers watcher notifications; set to false for bulk operations
- Retries can create duplicates; track created task IDs to avoid re-creation
- `custom_item_id` for milestones (ID 1) is subject to workspace plan quotas

### 2. Navigate Workspace Hierarchy

**When to use**: User wants to browse or manage the ClickUp workspace structure (Workspaces > Spaces > Folders > Lists).

**Tool sequence**:
1. `CLICKUP_GET_AUTHORIZED_TEAMS_WORKSPACES` - List all accessible workspaces [Required]
2. `CLICKUP_GET_SPACES` - List spaces within a workspace [Required]
3. `CLICKUP_GET_SPACE` - Get details for a specific space [Optional]
4. `CLICKUP_GET_FOLDERS` - List folders in a space [Required]
5. `CLICKUP_GET_FOLDER` - Get details for a specific folder [Optional]
6. `CLICKUP_CREATE_FOLDER` - Create a new folder in a space [Optional]
7. `CLICKUP_GET_FOLDERLESS_LISTS` - List lists not inside any folder [Required]
8. `CLICKUP_GET_LIST` - Get list details including statuses and custom fields [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `team_id`: Workspace ID from GET_AUTHORIZED_TEAMS_WORKSPACES (required for spaces)
- `space_id`: Space ID (required for folders and folderless lists)
- `folder_id`: Folder ID (required for GET_FOLDER)
- `list_id`: List ID (required for GET_LIST)
- `archived`: Boolean filter for archived/active items

**Pitfalls**:
- ClickUp hierarchy is: Workspace (Team) > Space > Folder > List > Task
- Lists can exist directly under Spaces (folderless) or inside Folders
- Must use `CLICKUP_GET_FOLDERLESS_LISTS` to find lists not inside folders; `CLICKUP_GET_FOLDERS` only returns folders
- `team_id` in ClickUp API refers to the Workspace ID, not a user group

### 3. Add Comments to Tasks

**When to use**: User wants to add comments, review existing comments, or manage comment threads on tasks.

**Tool sequence**:
1. `CLICKUP_GET_TASK` - Verify task exists and get task_id [Prerequisite]
2. `CLICKUP_CREATE_TASK_COMMENT` - Add a new comment to the task [Required]
3. `CLICKUP_GET_TASK_COMMENTS` - List existing comments on the task [Optional]
4. `CLICKUP_UPDATE_COMMENT` - Edit comment text, assignee, or resolution status [Optional]

**Key parameters for CLICKUP_CREATE_TASK_COMMENT**:
- `task_id`: Task ID string (required)
- `comment_text`: Comment content with ClickUp formatting support (required)
- `assignee`: User ID to assign the comment to (required)
- `notify_all`: true/false for watcher notifications (required)

**Key parameters for CLICKUP_GET_TASK_COMMENTS**:
- `task_id`: Task ID string (required)
- `start` / `start_id`: Pagination for older comments (max 25 per page)

**Pitfalls**:
- `CLICKUP_CREATE_TASK_COMMENT` requires all four fields: `task_id`, `comment_text`, `assignee`, and `notify_all`
- `assignee` on a comment assigns the comment (not the task) to that user
- Comments are paginated at 25 per page; use `start` (Unix ms) and `start_id` for older pages
- `CLICKUP_UPDATE_COMMENT` requires all four fields: `comment_id`, `comment_text`, `assignee`, `resolved`

### 4. Manage Team Members and Assignments

**When to use**: User wants to view workspace members, check seat utilization, or look up user details.

**Tool sequence**:
1. `CLICKUP_GET_AUTHORIZED_TEAMS_WORKSPACES` - List workspaces and get team_id [Required]
2. `CLICKUP_GET_WORKSPACE_SEATS` - Check seat utilization (members vs guests) [Required]
3. `CLICKUP_GET_TEAMS` - List user groups within the workspace [Optional]
4. `CLICKUP_GET_USER` - Get details for a specific user (Enterprise only) [Optional]
5. `CLICKUP_GET_CUSTOM_ROLES` - List custom permission roles [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `team_id`: Workspace ID (required for all team operations)
- `user_id`: Specific user ID for GET_USER
- `group_ids`: Comma-separated group IDs to filter teams

**Pitfalls**:
- `CLICKUP_GET_WORKSPACE_SEATS` returns seat counts, not member details; distinguish members from guests
- `CLICKUP_GET_TEAMS` returns user groups, not workspace members; empty groups does not mean no members
- `CLICKUP_GET_USER` is only available on ClickUp Enterprise Plan
- Must repeat workspace seat querie

(Shortened: the skill continues in its source.)

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
