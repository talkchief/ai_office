## 📋 The skill, as written
# Influencer Discovery

Discover and analyze influencers across multiple platforms using Apify Actors.

## When to Use
- You need to discover creators or influencers for outreach, partnerships, or campaign planning.
- The task is to evaluate authenticity, engagement, niche fit, or audience signals across social platforms.
- You need Apify-based extraction plus a shortlist or summary of suitable influencer candidates.

## Prerequisites
(No need to check it upfront)

- `.env` file with `APIFY_TOKEN`
- Node.js 20.6+ (for native `--env-file` support)
- `mcpc` CLI tool: `npm install -g @apify/mcpc`

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Determine discovery source (select Actor)
- [ ] Step 2: Fetch Actor schema via mcpc
- [ ] Step 3: Ask user preferences (format, filename)
- [ ] Step 4: Run the discovery script
- [ ] Step 5: Summarize results
```

### Step 1: Determine Discovery Source

Select the appropriate Actor based on user needs:

| User Need | Actor ID | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Influencer profiles | `apify/instagram-profile-scraper` | Profile metrics, bio, follower counts |
| Find by hashtag | `apify/instagram-hashtag-scraper` | Discover influencers using specific hashtags |
| Reel engagement | `apify/instagram-reel-scraper` | Analyze reel performance and engagement |
| Discovery by niche | `apify/instagram-search-scraper` | Search for influencers by keyword/niche |
| Brand mentions | `apify/instagram-tagged-scraper` | Track who tags brands/products |
| Comprehensive data | `apify/instagram-scraper` | Full profile, posts, comments analysis |
| API-based discovery | `apify/instagram-api-scraper` | Fast API-based data extraction |
| Engagement analysis | `apify/export-instagram-comments-posts` | Export comments for sentiment analysis |
| Facebook content | `apify/facebook-posts-scraper` | Analyze Facebook post performance |
| Micro-influencers | `apify/facebook-groups-scraper` | Find influencers in niche groups |
| Influential pages | `apify/facebook-search-scraper` | Search for influential pages |
| YouTube creators | `streamers/youtube-channel-scraper` | Channel metrics and subscriber data |
| TikTok influencers | `clockworks/tiktok-scraper` | Comprehensive TikTok data extraction |
| TikTok (free) | `clockworks/free-tiktok-scraper` | Free TikTok data extractor |
| Live streamers | `clockworks/tiktok-live-scraper` | Discover live streaming influencers |

### Step 2: Fetch Actor Schema

Fetch the Actor's input schema and details dynamically using mcpc:

```bash
export $(grep APIFY_TOKEN .env | xargs) && mcpc --json mcp.apify.com --header "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" tools-call fetch-actor-details actor:="ACTOR_ID" | jq -r ".content"
```

Replace `ACTOR_ID` with the selected Actor (e.g., `apify/instagram-profile-scraper`).

This returns:
- Actor description and README
- Required and optional input parameters
- Output fields (if available)

### Step 3: Ask User Preferences

Before running, ask:
1. **Output format**:
   - **Quick answer** - Display top few results in chat (no file saved)
   - **CSV** - Full export with all fields
   - **JSON** - Full export in JSON format
2. **Number of results**: Based on character of use case

### Step 4: Run the Script

**Quick answer (display in chat, no file):**
```bash
node --env-file=.env ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/scripts/run_actor.js \
  --actor "ACTOR_ID" \
  --input 'JSON_INPUT'
```

**CSV:**
```bash
node --env-file=.env ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/scripts/run_actor.js \
  --actor "ACTOR_ID" \
  --input 'JSON_INPUT' \
  --output YYYY-MM-DD_OUTPUT_FILE.csv \
  --format csv
```

**JSON:**
```bash
node --env-file=.env ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/scripts/run_actor.js \
  --actor "ACTOR_ID" \
  --input 'JSON_INPUT' \
  --output YYYY-MM-DD_OUTPUT_FILE.json \
  --format json
```

### Step 5: Summarize Results

After completion, report:
- Number of influencers found
- File location and name
- Key metrics available (followers, engagement rate, etc.)
- Suggested next steps (filtering, outreach, deeper analysis)

## Error Handling

`APIFY_TOKEN not found` - Ask user to create `.env` with `APIFY_TOKEN=your_token`
`mcpc not found` - Ask user to install `npm install -g @apify/mcpc`
`Actor not found` - Check Actor ID spelling
`Run FAILED` - Ask user to check Apify console link in error output
`Timeout` - Reduce input size or increase `--timeout`

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
