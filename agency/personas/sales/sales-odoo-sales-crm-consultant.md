## 📋 The skill, as written
# Odoo Sales & CRM Expert

## Overview

This skill helps you configure and optimize Odoo Sales and CRM. It covers opportunity pipeline setup, automated lead assignment, quotation templates, pricelist strategies, sales team management, and the sales-to-invoice workflow.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing CRM pipeline stages for your sales process.
- Creating a quotation template with optional products and bundles.
- Setting up pricelists with customer-tier pricing.
- Configuring automated lead assignment by territory or salesperson.

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-sales-crm-expert` and describe your sales scenario.
2. **Configure**: Receive step-by-step Odoo setup instructions.
3. **Optimize**: Get recommendations for improving pipeline velocity and deal closure rate.

## Examples

### Example 1: Configure CRM Pipeline Stages

```text
Menu: CRM → Configuration → Stages → New

Typical B2B Pipeline:
  Stage 1: New Lead          (probability: 10%)
  Stage 2: Qualified         (probability: 25%)
  Stage 3: Proposal Sent     (probability: 50%)
  Stage 4: Negotiation       (probability: 75%)
  Stage 5: Won               (is_won: YES — marks opportunity as closed-won)
  Stage 6: Lost              (mark as lost via the "Mark as Lost" button)

Tips:
  - Enable "Rotting Days" in CRM Settings to flag stale deals in red
  - In Odoo 16+, Predictive Lead Scoring (AI) auto-updates probability
    based on historical data. Disable it in Settings if you prefer manual
    stage-based probability.
```

### Example 2: Create a Quotation Template

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Use **Lost Reasons** (CRM → Configuration → Lost Reasons) to build a dataset of why deals are lost — invaluable for sales coaching.
- ✅ **Do:** Enable **Sales Teams** with revenue targets so pipeline forecasting is meaningful per team.
- ✅ **Do:** Set **Expected Revenue** and **Closing Date** on every opportunity — these feed the revenue forecast dashboard.
- ✅ **Do:** Use **Quotation Templates** to standardize offers and reduce quoting time across the team.
- ❌ **Don't:** Skip the CRM opportunity when selling — going directly from lead to invoice breaks pipeline analytics.
- ❌ **Don't:** Manually edit prices on quotation lines as a workaround — set up proper pricelists instead.
- ❌ **Don't:** Ignore the **Predictive Lead Scoring** feature in v16+ — configure it with historical data for accurate forecasting.

## Limitations

- **Commission rules** are not built into Odoo CRM out of the box — they require custom development or third-party modules.
- The **Quotation Template** optional product feature requires the **Sale Management** module; it is not available in the base `sale` module.
- **Territory-based lead assignment** (geographic routing) requires custom rules or the Enterprise Leads module.
- Odoo CRM does not have native **email sequence / cadence** automation — use the **Email Marketing** or **Marketing Automation** modules for drip campaigns.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
