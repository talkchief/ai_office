Design free tiers that let developers build real things, demonstrate value, and convert naturally—without feeling like a trap or creating resentment.

## Overview

Developer tools need free tiers. Developers expect to try before they buy, and they expect the trial to be meaningful—not a 14-day timer or a feature-locked demo. But free tiers also need to sustain your business. Get this wrong in either direction: too restrictive kills adoption, too generous kills revenue.

The best free tiers feel generous to individual developers while naturally scaling into paid tiers as projects grow.

## Before You Start

Review the `/devmarketing-skills/skills/developer-audience-context` skill. Free tier design varies significantly based on whether you're targeting hobbyists, startups, or enterprises. Also understand your unit economics—what does each free user actually cost you?

## Free Tier vs Free Trial vs Freemium

### Definitions

**Free trial:** Time-limited full access (14 or 30 days)
- Best for: High-touch enterprise sales
- Worst for: Developer tools with self-serve motion

**Free tier:** Permanently free with usage/feature limits
- Best for: Developer tools with self-serve adoption
- Requires: Careful limit design

**Freemium:** Free tier plus premium features for payment
- Best for: Tools with clear hobby/pro distinction
- Requires: Obvious value in premium features

**Open core:** Free open source with commercial additions
- Best for: Infrastructure and platforms
- Requires: Active open source community

### Choosing Your Model

| Factor | Free Trial | Free Tier | Freemium | Open Core |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Sales motion | High-touch | Self-serve | Self-serve | Mixed |
| Time to evaluate | Weeks | Months | Months | Unlimited |
| Conversion pressure | High | Low | Medium | None |
| Community building | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| Support costs | High | Low | Medium | Variable |

**Developer tools almost always need a permanent free tier, not a free trial.** Developers build side projects, evaluate tools for future use, and recommend tools to others—all of which require long-term free access.

## Usage Limits That Make Sense

### Good Limit Dimensions

**API calls/requests**
- Developers understand and can track
- Scales naturally with application growth
- Example: 10,000 requests/month

**Compute resources**
- Clear relationship to cost
- Predictable for developers
- Example: 500 build minutes/month

**Storage**
- Easy to understand
- Natural upgrade trigger as data grows
- Example: 1GB storage

**Seats/users**
- Makes sense for collaboration tools
- Natural upgrade for team growth
- Example: Up to 3 team members

### Bad Limit Dimensions

**Time-based trials disguised as free tiers**
- "Free tier expires after 90 days of inactivity"
- Creates anxiety and resentment

**Arbitrary feature combinations**
- "Free: 3 projects with 2 environments each, max 5 databases per environment, 100MB per database"
- Too complex to evaluate

**Limits that punish success**
- "Free up to 100 monthly active users"
- Your most successful free users hit limits fastest

### The Goldilocks Zone

Free tier limits should:
1. **Allow meaningful usage** - Build and run a real side project
2. **Cover hobbyist use cases** - Personal projects should never require payment
3. **Trigger on growth, not time** - Upgrades happen because projects succeed
4. **Be easy to predict** - Developers should know when they'll hit limits

### Example: Good Limit Structure

**Vercel:**
- Unlimited personal projects
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Serverless function limits
- Hobby use stays free forever

**Supabase:**
- 500MB database storage
- 2GB bandwidth
- 50,000 monthly active users
- Social auth unlimited

**PlanetScale:**
- 1 database
- 1 billion row reads/month
- 10 million row writes/month
- 5GB storage

## Feature Gating Strategies

### The Free Features Principle

Free tiers should include everything needed to:
1. Evaluate the product thoroughly
2. Build and ship a real project
3. Operate in production at small scale

### Features to Keep Free

- Core functionality
- All integrations and SDKs
- Standard authentication
- Basic monitoring and logs
- Documentation and community support
- Development and testing environments

### Features to Gate Behind Paid Tiers

**Collaboration features:**
- Team members beyond the solo developer
- Access controls and permissions
- Audit logs

**Scale and performance:**
- Higher rate limits
- More compute/storage
- Premium infrastructure (dedicated instances)

**Enterprise requirements:**
- SSO/SAML
- SLAs and uptime guarantees
- Priority support
- Compliance certifications
- Custom contracts

### Feature Gating Anti-Patterns

**Gating basic developer needs:**
```
Bad: Custom domains require paid plan
(Custom domains are table stakes)

Bad: CI/CD integration requires paid plan
(This is how developers deploy)

Bad: Environment variables limited on free
(This is basic functionality)
```

**Gating that breaks evaluation:**
```
Bad: "Advanced features" available for 7 days then locked
(Developers can't properly evaluate)

Bad: Production deploys require credit card
(Can't demonstrate to stakeholders)
```

(Shortened: the skill continues in its source.)

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
