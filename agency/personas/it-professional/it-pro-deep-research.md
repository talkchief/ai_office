## 📋 The skill, as written
# Gemini Deep Research Skill

Run autonomous research tasks that plan, search, read, and synthesize information into comprehensive reports.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Performing market analysis
- Conducting competitive landscaping
- Creating literature reviews
- Doing technical research
- Performing due diligence
- Need detailed, cited research reports

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- httpx: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable

## Setup

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file in the skill directory.

## Usage

### Start a research task
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Research the history of Kubernetes"
```

### With structured output format
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Compare Python web frameworks" \
  --format "1. Executive Summary\n2. Comparison Table\n3. Recommendations"
```

### Stream progress in real-time
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Analyze EV battery market" --stream
```

### Start without waiting
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Research topic" --no-wait
```

### Check status of running research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --status <interaction_id>
```

### Wait for completion
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --wait <interaction_id>
```

### Continue from previous research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Elaborate on point 2" --continue <interaction_id>
```

### List recent research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --list
```

## Output Formats

- **Default**: Human-readable markdown report
- **JSON** (`--json`): Structured data for programmatic use
- **Raw** (`--raw`): Unprocessed API response

## Cost & Time

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time | 2-10 minutes per task |
| Cost | $2-5 per task (varies by complexity) |
| Token usage | ~250k-900k input, ~60k-80k output |

## Best Use Cases

- Market analysis and competitive landscaping
- Technical literature reviews
- Due diligence research
- Historical research and timelines
- Comparative analysis (frameworks, products, technologies)

## Workflow

1. User requests research → Run `--query "..."`
2. Inform user of estimated time (2-10 minutes)
3. Monitor with `--stream` or poll with `--status`
4. Return formatted results
5. Use `--continue` for follow-up questions

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success
- **1**: Error (API error, config issue, timeout)
- **130**: Cancelled by user (Ctrl+C)

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
