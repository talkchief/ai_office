- Cite the skill by name in the report so the lead knows which method was applied

## 📋 The skill, as written
# Hugging Face Local Models
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need use to select models to run locally with llama.cpp and GGUF on CPU, Mac Metal, CUDA, or ROCm. Covers finding GGUFs, quant selection, running servers, exact GGUF file lookup, conversion, and OpenAI-compatible local serving.


Search the Hugging Face Hub for llama.cpp-compatible GGUF repos, choose the right quant, and launch the model with `llama-cli` or `llama-server`.

## Default Workflow

1. Search the Hub with `apps=llama.cpp`.
2. Open `https://huggingface.co/<repo>?local-app=llama.cpp`.
3. Prefer the exact HF local-app snippet and quant recommendation when it is visible.
4. Confirm exact `.gguf` filenames with `https://huggingface.co/api/models/<repo>/tree/main?recursive=true`.
5. Launch with `llama-cli -hf <repo>:<QUANT>` or `llama-server -hf <repo>:<QUANT>`.
6. Fall back to `--hf-repo` plus `--hf-file` when the repo uses custom file naming.
7. Convert from Transformers weights only if the repo does not already expose GGUF files.

## Quick Start

### Install llama.cpp

```bash
brew install llama.cpp
winget install llama.cpp
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make
```

### Authenticate for gated repos

```bash
hf auth login
```

### Search the Hub

```text
https://huggingface.co/models?apps=llama.cpp&sort=trending
https://huggingface.co/models?search=Qwen3.6&apps=llama.cpp&sort=trending
https://huggingface.co/models?search=<term>&apps=llama.cpp&num_parameters=min:0,max:24B&sort=trending
```

### Run directly from the Hub

```bash
llama-cli -hf unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M
llama-server -hf unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M
```

### Run an exact GGUF file

```bash
llama-server \
    --hf-repo unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF \
    --hf-file Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf \
    -c 4096
```

### Convert only when no GGUF is available

```bash
hf download <repo-without-gguf> --local-dir ./model-src
python convert_hf_to_gguf.py ./model-src \
    --outfile model-f16.gguf \
    --outtype f16
llama-quantize model-f16.gguf model-q4_k_m.gguf Q4_K_M
```

### Smoke test a local server

```bash
llama-server -hf unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer no-key" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Write a limerick about exception handling"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Quant Choice

- Prefer the exact quant that HF marks as compatible on the `?local-app=llama.cpp` page.
- Keep repo-native labels such as `UD-Q4_K_M` instead of normalizing them.
- Default to `Q4_K_M` unless the repo page or hardware profile suggests otherwise.
- Prefer `Q5_K_M` or `Q6_K` for code or technical workloads when memory allows.
- Consider `Q3_K_M`, `Q4_K_S`, or repo-specific `IQ` / `UD-*` variants for tighter RAM or VRAM budgets.
- Treat `mmproj-*.gguf` files as projector weights, not the main checkpoint.

## Load References

- Read [hub-discovery.md](references/hub-discovery.md) for URL-first workflows, model search, tree API extraction, and command reconstruction.
- Read [quantization.md](references/quantization.md) for format tables, model scaling, quality tradeoffs, and `imatrix`.
- Read [hardware.md](references/hardware.md) for Metal, CUDA, ROCm, or CPU build and acceleration details.

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream product or API scope.
- Verify commands, API behavior, pricing, quotas, credentials, and deployment effects against current official documentation before making changes.
- Do not treat generated examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
