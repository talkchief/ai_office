## 📋 The skill, as written
# Address GitHub Comments

## Overview

Efficiently address PR review comments or issue feedback using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). This skill ensures all feedback is addressed systematically.

## Prerequisites

Ensure `gh` is authenticated.

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not logged in, run `gh auth login`.

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect Comments

Fetch the comments for the current branch's PR.

```bash
gh pr view --comments
```

Or use a custom script if available to list threads.

### 2. Categorize and Plan

- List the comments and review threads.
- Propose a fix for each.
- **Wait for user confirmation** on which comments to address first if there are many.

### 3. Apply Fixes

Apply the code changes for the selected comments.

### 4. Respond to Comments

Once fixed, respond to the threads as resolved.

```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "Addressed in latest commit."
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Applying fixes without understanding context**: Always read the surrounding code of a comment.
- **Not verifying auth**: Check `gh auth status` before starting.

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
