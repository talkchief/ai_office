## 📋 The skill, as written
# App Store Changelog

## Overview
Generate a comprehensive, user-facing changelog from git history since the last tag, then translate commits into clear App Store release notes.

## When to Use
- When the user asks for App Store "What's New" text or release notes from git history.
- When you need to turn raw commits into concise, user-facing release bullets.

## Workflow

### 1) Collect changes
- Run `scripts/collect_release_changes.sh` from the repo root to gather commits and touched files.
- If needed, pass a specific tag or ref: `scripts/collect_release_changes.sh v1.2.3 HEAD`.
- If no tags exist, the script falls back to full history.

### 2) Triage for user impact
- Scan commits and files to identify user-visible changes.
- Group changes by theme (New, Improved, Fixed) and deduplicate overlaps.
- Drop internal-only work (build scripts, refactors, dependency bumps, CI).

### 3) Draft App Store notes
- Write short, benefit-focused bullets for each user-facing change.
- Use clear verbs and plain language; avoid internal jargon.
- Prefer 5 to 10 bullets unless the user requests a different length.

### 4) Validate
- Ensure every bullet maps back to a real change in the range.
- Check for duplicates and overly technical wording.
- Ask for clarification if any change is ambiguous or possibly internal-only.

## Commit-to-Bullet Examples

The following shows how raw commits are translated into App Store bullets:

| Raw commit message | App Store bullet |
|---|---|
| `fix(auth): resolve token refresh race condition on iOS 17` | • Fixed a login issue that could leave some users unexpectedly signed out. |
| `feat(search): add voice input to search bar` | • Search your library hands-free with the new voice input option. |
| `perf(timeline): lazy-load images to reduce scroll jank` | • Scrolling through your timeline is now smoother and faster. |

Internal-only commits that are **dropped** (no user impact):
- `chore: upgrade fastlane to 2.219`
- `refactor(network): extract URLSession wrapper into module`
- `ci: add nightly build job`

## Example Output

```
What's New in Version 3.4

• Search your library hands-free with the new voice input option.
• Scrolling through your timeline is now smoother and faster.
• Fixed a login issue that could leave some users unexpectedly signed out.
• Added dark-mode support to the settings screen.
• Improved load times when opening large photo albums.
```

## Output Format
- Title (optional): "What's New" or product name + version.
- Bullet list only; one sentence per bullet.
- Stick to storefront limits if the user provides one.

## Resources
- `scripts/collect_release_changes.sh`: Collect commits and touched files since last tag.
- `references/release-notes-guidelines.md`: Language, filtering, and QA rules for App Store notes.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
