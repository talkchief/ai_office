## Migration to Call Automation

```xml
<!-- OLD (deprecated) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-callingserver</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.5</version>
</dependency>

<!-- NEW (use this instead) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-callautomation</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Class Name Changes

| CallingServer (Old) | Call Automation (New) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| `CallingServerClient` | `CallAutomationClient` |
| `CallingServerClientBuilder` | `CallAutomationClientBuilder` |
| `CallConnection` | `CallConnection` (same) |
| `ServerCall` | Removed - use `CallConnection` |

## Legacy Client Creation

```java
// OLD WAY (deprecated)
import com.azure.communication.callingserver.CallingServerClient;
import com.azure.communication.callingserver.CallingServerClientBuilder;

CallingServerClient client = new CallingServerClientBuilder()
    .connectionString("<connection-string>")
    .buildClient();

// NEW WAY
import com.azure.communication.callautomation.CallAutomationClient;
import com.azure.communication.callautomation.CallAutomationClientBuilder;

CallAutomationClient client = new CallAutomationClientBuilder()
    .connectionString("<connection-string>")
    .buildClient();
```

## Legacy Recording

```java
// OLD WAY
StartRecordingOptions options = new StartRecordingOptions(serverCallId)
    .setRecordingStateCallbackUri(callbackUri);

StartCallRecordingResult result = client.startRecording(options);
String recordingId = result.getRecordingId();

client.pauseRecording(recordingId);
client.resumeRecording(recordingId);
client.stopRecording(recordingId);

// NEW WAY - see azure-communication-callautomation skill
```

## For New Development

**Do not use this SDK for new projects.** 

See the `azure-communication-callautomation-java` skill for:
- Making outbound calls
- Answering incoming calls
- Call recording
- DTMF recognition
- Text-to-speech / speech-to-text
- Adding/removing participants
- Call transfer

## Trigger Phrases

- "callingserver legacy", "deprecated calling SDK"
- "migrate callingserver to callautomation"

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
