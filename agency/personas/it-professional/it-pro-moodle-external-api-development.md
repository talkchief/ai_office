## Examples from Real Implementation

### Simple Read API (Get Quiz Attempts)

```php
<?php
namespace local_userlog\external;

defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();
require_once("$CFG->libdir/externallib.php");

use external_api;
use external_function_parameters;
use external_single_structure;
use external_value;

class get_quiz_attempts extends external_api {
    public static function execute_parameters() {
        return new external_function_parameters([
            'userid' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'User ID'),
            'courseid' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Course ID')
        ]);
    }

    public static function execute($userid, $courseid) {
        global $DB;

        self::validate_parameters(self::execute_parameters(), [
            'userid' => $userid,
            'courseid' => $courseid
        ]);

        $sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) AS quiz_attempts
                FROM {quiz_attempts} qa
                JOIN {quiz} q ON qa.quiz = q.id
                WHERE qa.userid = :userid AND q.course = :courseid";

        $attempts = $DB->get_field_sql($sql, [
            'userid' => $userid,
            'courseid' => $courseid
        ]);

        return ['quiz_attempts' => (int)$attempts];
    }

    public static function execute_returns() {
        return new external_single_structure([
            'quiz_attempts' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Total number of quiz attempts')
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Complex Write API (Create Quiz from Categories)

See attached `create_quiz_from_categories.php` for a comprehensive example including:
- Multiple database insertions
- Course module creation
- Quiz instance configuration
- Random question selection with tags
- Group-based access restrictions
- Extensive error logging
- Transaction management

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
