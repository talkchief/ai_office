## 📋 The skill, as written
# Wiki Q&A

Answer repository questions grounded entirely in source code evidence.

## When to Use
- User asks a question about the codebase
- User wants to understand a specific file, function, or component
- User asks "how does X work" or "where is Y defined"

## Procedure

1. Detect the language of the question; respond in the same language
2. Search the codebase for relevant files
3. Read those files to gather evidence
4. Synthesize an answer with inline citations

## Response Format

- Use `##` headings, code blocks with language tags, tables, bullet lists
- Cite sources inline: `(src/path/file.ts:42)`
- Include a "Key Files" table mapping files to their roles
- If information is insufficient, say so and suggest files to examine

## Rules

- ONLY use information from actual source files
- NEVER invent, guess, or use external knowledge
- Think step by step before answering

### When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

## Example

**User request:**

> Answer this repository question using only source-code evidence, with direct file and line references.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
