## Scope Gate (Ask First if Missing)

Before performing a full audit, clarify:

1. **Business Context**

   * Site type (SaaS, e-commerce, blog, local, marketplace, etc.)
   * Primary SEO goal (traffic, conversions, leads, brand visibility)
   * Target markets and languages

2. **SEO Focus**

   * Full site audit or specific sections/pages?
   * Technical SEO, on-page, content, or all?
   * Desktop, mobile, or both?

3. **Data Access**

   * Google Search Console access?
   * Analytics access?
   * Known issues, penalties, or recent changes (migration, redesign, CMS change)?

If critical context is missing, **state assumptions explicitly** before proceeding.

---

## Audit Framework (Priority Order)

1. **Crawlability & Indexation** – Can search engines access and index the site?
2. **Technical Foundations** – Is the site fast, stable, and accessible?
3. **On-Page Optimization** – Is each page clearly optimized for its intent?
4. **Content Quality & E-E-A-T** – Does the content deserve to rank?
5. **Authority & Signals** – Does the site demonstrate trust and relevance?

## Technical SEO Audit

### Crawlability

**Robots.txt**

* Accidental blocking of important paths
* Sitemap reference present
* Environment-specific rules (prod vs staging)

**XML Sitemaps**

* Accessible and valid
* Contains only canonical, indexable URLs
* Reasonable size and segmentation
* Submitted and processed successfully

**Site Architecture**

* Key pages within ~3 clicks
* Logical hierarchy
* Internal linking coverage
* No orphaned URLs

**Crawl Efficiency (Large Sites)**

* Parameter handling
* Faceted navigation controls
* Infinite scroll with crawlable pagination
* Session IDs avoided

---

### Indexation

**Coverage Analysis**

* Indexed vs expected pages
* Excluded URLs (intentional vs accidental)

**Common Indexation Issues**

* Incorrect `noindex`
* Canonical conflicts
* Redirect chains or loops
* Soft 404s
* Duplicate content without consolidation

**Canonicalization Consistency**

* Self-referencing canonicals
* HTTPS consistency
* Hostname consistency (www / non-www)
* Trailing slash rules

---

### Performance & Core Web Vitals

**Key Metrics**

* LCP at or below 2.5s
* INP at or below 200ms
* CLS at or below 0.1

Evaluate field data at the 75th percentile with the relevant device population. Keep lab diagnostics distinct from observed field performance; see [Google’s Core Web Vitals guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals).

**Contributing Factors**

* Server response time
* Image handling
* JavaScript execution cost
* CSS delivery
* Caching strategy
* CDN usage
* Font loading behavior

---

### Mobile-Friendliness

* Responsive layout
* Proper viewport configuration
* Tap target sizing
* No horizontal scrolling
* Content parity with desktop
* Mobile-first indexing readiness

---

### Security & Accessibility Signals

* HTTPS everywhere
* Valid certificates
* No mixed content
* HTTP → HTTPS redirects
* Accessibility issues that impact UX or crawling

---

## On-Page SEO Audit

### Title Tags

* Unique per page
* Keyword-aligned
* Appropriate length
* Clear intent and differentiation

### Meta Descriptions

### Heading Structure

* One clear H1
* Logical hierarchy
* Headings reflect content structure

### Content Optimization

* Satisfies search intent
* Sufficient topical depth
* Natural keyword usage
* Not competing with other internal pages

### Images

* Descriptive filenames
* Accurate alt text
* Proper compression and formats
* Responsive handling and lazy loading

### Internal Linking

---

## 🔢 SEO Health Index & Scoring Layer (Additive)

### Purpose

The optional **SEO Health Index** is a subjective audit rubric, not a validated search-engine metric. It can organize findings only when its weights, scope and deductions are disclosed. Do not invent points for unavailable data or imply an effect on rankings.

It is designed to:

* Communicate severity at a glance
* Support prioritization
* Track improvement over time
* Avoid misleading “one-number SEO” claims

---

## Scoring Model Overview

### Total Score: **0–100**

The score is a **weighted composite**, not an average.

| Category                  | Weight  |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| Crawlability & Indexation | 30      |
| Technical Foundations     | 25      |
| On-Page Optimization      | 20      |
| Content Quality & E-E-A-T | 15      |
| Authority & Trust Signals | 10      |
| **Total**                 | **100** |

> Mark uninspected categories as unknown. If presenting a scoped score, name its scope and do not compare it with an earlier full-site score.

---

## Category Scoring Rules

Each category is scored **independently**, then weighted.

### Per-Category Score: 0–100

Start each category at **100** and subtract points based on issues found.

#### Severity Deductions

| Issue Severity                              | Deduction  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Critical (blocks crawling/indexing/ranking) | −15 to −30 |
| High impact                                 | −10        |
| Medium impact                               | −5         |
| Low impact / cosmetic                       | −1 to −3   |

#### Confidence Modifier

Keep confidence separate from severity. An uncertain critical finding needs verification; reducing its numerical deduction does not make the site safer to index.

---

## Example (Category)

> Crawlability & Indexation (Weight: 30)

* Noindex on key category pages → Critical (−25, High confidence)
* XML sitemap includes redirected URLs → Medium (−5, Medium confidence; verify separately)
* Missing sitemap reference in robots.txt → Low (−2)

**Raw score:** 100 − 32 = **68**
**Weighted contribution:** 68 × 0.30 = **20.4**

(Shortened: the skill continues in its source.)

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
