# Terraform Infrastructure Workflow

## Overview

Specialized workflow for infrastructure as code using Terraform including resource provisioning, module creation, state management, and multi-environment deployments.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use this workflow when:

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Resources provisioned
- [ ] Modules working
- [ ] State configured
- [ ] Multi-env tested
- [ ] CI/CD working
- [ ] Security verified

## Related Workflow Bundles

- `cloud-devops` - Cloud/DevOps
- `kubernetes-deployment` - Kubernetes
- `aws-infrastructure` - AWS specific

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 🚨 Critical Rules
- Follow the skill's own rules; where they conflict with the office's rules, the office wins: read freely, act outside the office only after the CEO approves
- Never invent numbers or facts: they come from the Brain or the brief, and you say when they are missing
- Deliverables go to /work/ as files; the lead reviews them, you do not mark anything complete
- Say which step of the skill produced each part of the result
